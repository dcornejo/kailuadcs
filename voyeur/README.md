# DCS Watcher

This program just logs activity on DcsFeed in redis.

Unlike most other programs in this suite, it is *not* started from
the ops daemon - you invoke it directly from the command line.

In the voyeur directory run the program like this:

```
% ./voyeur
```

This is a work in progress, feature requests welcome.
